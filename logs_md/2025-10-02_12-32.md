📊 TRADING HISTORY FOR BNBUSDC:

  • Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 80%) at 2025-10-02 10:26:07 UTC
  • Last explanation: RSI 75 indicates overbought; short‑term candles still up but upper wick suggests a reversal is likely. The price has just topped its recent high ($1042.43) and the 5‑candle trend is still weakly bullish. A quick pullback to ~1030–1040 would give a 2% gain if we re‑enter. Holding now keeps us in the position and positions us to buy back at a lower level, targeting a 2% profit on the next rally. The risk of a larger pullback is low given the recent volume and lack of bearish divergence, so we keep the BNB on hand.

  • Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 85%) at 2025-10-02 10:26:39 UTC
  • Last explanation: Current price is below both SMA and EMA, indicating short‑term bearish bias. RSI sits at 51 – neutral, no clear bullish reversal. Volatility is low and recent candles show a short‑term downtrend. Holding preserves the small BTC position, allowing us to capture any breakout while avoiding a premature sell that might lock in losses. The 2% target is unlikely to materialize within the next few minutes given the current trend.
