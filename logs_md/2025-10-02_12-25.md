  • Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 70%) at 2025-10-02 10:22:20 UTC
  • Last explanation: RSI overbought signals a short‑term pullback; price is above key SMAs but near recent highs. A quick 2% take‑profit to ~$1060 is unlikely within minutes, and the last five candles show a minor downtrend. Holding allows us to capture any rebound or a 2% gain if the price retraces and then resumes its uptrend.

📊 TRADING HISTORY FOR BTCUSDC:
  • Total decisions: 351 (Buy: 17, Sell: 13, Hold: 321)
  • Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 90%) at 2025-10-02 10:22:53 UTC
  • Last explanation: Current price sits just above the 20‑period SMA/EMA, confirming a short‑term bullish bias. However the WMA is below both averages, RSI hovers at 57 (neutral), and recent candles show only a modest uptick. Volatility remains low, making a 2% move in the next minutes unlikely. Holding preserves capital and allows us to capture any breakout that may appear later, aligning with the 2% target while avoiding over‑trading.
