  ‚Ä¢ Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 70%) at 2025-10-02 10:22:20 UTC
  ‚Ä¢ Last explanation: RSI overbought signals a short‚Äëterm pullback; price is above key SMAs but near recent highs. A quick 2% take‚Äëprofit to ~$1060 is unlikely within minutes, and the last five candles show a minor downtrend. Holding allows us to capture any rebound or a 2% gain if the price retraces and then resumes its uptrend.

üìä TRADING HISTORY FOR BTCUSDC:
  ‚Ä¢ Total decisions: 351 (Buy: 17, Sell: 13, Hold: 321)
  ‚Ä¢ Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 90%) at 2025-10-02 10:22:53 UTC
  ‚Ä¢ Last explanation: Current price sits just above the 20‚Äëperiod SMA/EMA, confirming a short‚Äëterm bullish bias. However the WMA is below both averages, RSI hovers at 57 (neutral), and recent candles show only a modest uptick. Volatility remains low, making a 2% move in the next minutes unlikely. Holding preserves capital and allows us to capture any breakout that may appear later, aligning with the 2% target while avoiding over‚Äëtrading.

  ‚Ä¢ Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 90%) at 2025-10-02 10:24:37 UTC
  ‚Ä¢ Last explanation: RSI is overbought (75) indicating a likely short-term pullback. Current price sits just above SMA(20), but the 2% target (~$0.2415) is not yet within reach and the recent consolidation suggests a reversal may occur soon. Holding preserves capital for a stronger entry once price retraces to the SMA or below, maximizing potential profit while minimizing risk.
