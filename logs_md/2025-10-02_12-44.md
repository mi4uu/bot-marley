  • Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 92%) at 2025-10-02 10:40:32 UTC
  • Last explanation: BNBBTC is currently at its upper Bollinger band with RSI ~66, indicating overbought conditions and low bandwidth suggesting a consolidation phase. Historical pattern shows that holding during such squeeze often precedes a breakout or pullback. Given the short‑term volatility and our goal of 2% gains within minutes, a quick sell would likely trigger a retracement below the current level, eroding potential profit. Holding allows us to capture any breakout while preserving capital for a more favorable entry later.
  • Recent decisions:
    - HOLD (92%) on 10-02 10:40
