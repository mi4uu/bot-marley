{
  "confidence": 90,
  "explanation": "Current market shows a slight bearish bias: price sits just below the 20‑period SMA/EMA and RSI is neutral at 43.5, indicating no clear upward momentum yet. The recent candle trend is weakly up but the bandwidth remains tight, suggesting that a breakout could still occur but without a strong driver. With only 0.027 ETH available and an insufficient BTC balance to purchase more, the most prudent move is to hold until a clearer bullish signal emerges. This preserves capital and positions us for a potential 2% scalping opportunity if the price breaks above the 20‑period average.",

Recent candles show a tight squeeze and low bandwidth, indicating consolidation rather than a breakout. A 2% move upward would require breaking the upper band, which is unlikely within the next 10 minutes.
