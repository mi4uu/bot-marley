📊 TRADING HISTORY FOR BTCUSDC:

  • Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 90%) at 2025-10-02 10:33:28 UTC
  • Last explanation: Current price sits just above SMA and EMA, RSI indicates neutral momentum. Recent candles show a brief 5‑minute downtrend but overall volatility is low and no clear bearish reversal pattern. Given the small BTC position, holding preserves potential upside while avoiding a premature sell that could lock in losses. No 2% target is likely within the next few minutes, so I recommend holding until a clearer breakout signal emerges.

  • Last explanation: RSI bearish at 36, Bollinger bands below lower band indicating oversold but low volatility squeeze suggests potential breakout. Current short‑term trend is sideways, no clear upward momentum. With only 0.00089457 BTC (~0.024 ETH) and aiming for a 2 % gain, the risk of a further dip outweighs potential profit. Holding preserves capital until a clearer bullish signal emerges.

  • Last decision: HOLD (Confidence: 85%) at 2025-10-02 10:34:45 UTC
  • Last explanation: BNBBTC is in a tight squeeze with price near upper Bollinger band, RSI ~60 indicating no strong momentum. Recent candles show a short‑term uptrend but volatility is low (bandwidth 0.0056). A 2% move upwards would require a breakout beyond the current upper band, which is unlikely in the next 10 minutes. Holding allows us to capture a potential breakout while avoiding a pullback. The last decision was also hold with high confidence, and there is no immediate bearish signal.
