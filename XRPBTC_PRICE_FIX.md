# XRP/BTC Price Display Fix

## Problem
The XRP/BTC pair price tool was showing all price values as $0.0000 instead of the actual small decimal values (around $0.00002501).

## Root Cause
The price formatting functions were using fixed 4 decimal places (`{:.4}`), which was insufficient for very small cryptocurrency pair values like XRP/BTC that require 8 decimal places to display meaningful precision.

## Solution
Updated the price formatting logic in `src/tools/get_prices.rs` to dynamically determine the appropriate number of decimal places based on price magnitude:

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `format_for_display()` method** (lines 48-66):
   - Added dynamic decimal place calculation
   - Uses 8 decimal places for values < 0.001 (like XRP/BTC)
   - Uses 6 decimal places for values < 1.0
   - Uses 4 decimal places for regular values

2. **Updated `format_klines_for_ai()` function** (lines 169-185):
   - Applied same dynamic formatting to current price, period high, and period low displays
   - Ensures consistent formatting across all price displays

### Technical Details
```rust
let decimal_places = if price < 0.001 {
    8  // For very small values like XRP/BTC
} else if price < 1.0 {
    6  // For small values
} else {
    4  // For regular values
};
```

## Result
- **Before**: All prices showed as $0.0000
- **After**: XRP/BTC prices now display correctly as $0.00002501, $0.00002503, etc.

## Testing
Created and ran test cases confirming the fix works for XRP/BTC-sized values while maintaining compatibility with regular cryptocurrency prices.

## Impact
This fix resolves the price display issue for all cryptocurrency pairs with very small decimal values, not just XRP/BTC.
